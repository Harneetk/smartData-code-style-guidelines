# smartData-code-style-guidelines

Coding style is how your code looks, plain and simple. Everyone has their own style because of the way they learned to code. You may even notice that your style changes from language to language. Coding style is made up of numerous small decisions based on the language:

How and when to use comments,
Tabs or spaces for indentation (and how many spaces),
Appropriate use of white space,
Proper naming of variables and functions,
Code grouping an organization,
Patterns to be used,
Patterns to be avoided.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, as coding style can be extremely fine-grained or more general.


##Why Code Style is important :

-- Communication is key : As developers, we communicate primarily through code. When everyone is writing code that looks different, everyone is constantly trying to visually parse the code before being able to understand it. When everyone is writing code that looks the same, your brain can relax a bit as the understanding comes faster. Your code should clearly communicate its purpose to the casual observer. Keep in mind, your code is destined to be maintained by somebody other than you.

-- Be Kind to your future Self : Most developers have experienced looking at a very old piece of code that they wrote and not having any idea why they wrote it. It’s not that your memory is bad, it’s just that you make so many of these little decisions while writing code that it’s impossible to keep track of them all. So when you decide when and where to use comments, as well as which patterns should and shouldn’t be used, you are leaving a breadcrumb trail for your future self to find your way back to the meaning of the code.
